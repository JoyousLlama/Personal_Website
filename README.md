# Portfolio_Website

## Description
This is the website I made to act as a simple Portfolio / Blog. It's designed to be fairly responsive and utilizes several AWS services. I've redacted much of the information and replaced it with Lorem Ipsum text.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries)
- JavaScript
- AWS S3 (for hosting static files)
- CloudFront
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway (for backend functionality)

## Notes
- I'm not expecting anyone to actually download / use this repo, really
- The site is still a work-in-progress, but I'd call it a solid 1.0 as of now (10/20/24)
